user guide for program

ZipApp2 is a program that deals with creating an index for ease of access to a data file of zipcode data
the only part the user needs to interact with is compilation and two command line inputs as well as knowing the zip code they want to search for

to run the program enter the file path it is in on the command line and type 

g++ ZipApp2.cpp -o find

into the consol followed by

./find

on the ./find line in the consol add a space and begin entering the zipcodes you want to look for eg"56301" 

so finished it would look like 

g++ ZipApp2.cpp -o find
./find 56301 65402

you can enter in any number of zip codes
